# M4 — Vulkan Renderer & Interaction

**Goal:** see and play any board the engine supports, including 3-D, 4-D and
higher, with seams and wrapping made legible. Deliberately narrow scope: one
material, instanced geometry, no PBR, no shadows, no post-processing.

**Exit condition:** a human can play standard chess, Raumschach, a 4-D variant
and a Klein-bottle variant with a mouse, at ≥ 60 fps, validation-layer clean.

## M4.1 Foundation

- SDL3 window/input; Vulkan 1.3 with dynamic rendering and `synchronization2`
  (no render-pass or framebuffer objects to maintain); VMA for memory; shaderc
  invoked by CMake to produce SPIR-V at build time (no runtime compilation).
- Device selection with explicit required-feature list and a readable failure
  message when unmet.
- Frames-in-flight = 2, per-frame descriptor and staging arenas, timeline
  semaphores. Bindless-ish single descriptor set for textures.
- Validation layers on in Debug; **a test run with validation errors is a failing
  test** (CI runs a headless swapchainless smoke frame). **[INVARIANT]**
- A `RENDERDOC=1` path documented for capture-based debugging.

## M4.2 Engine/renderer boundary **[INVARIANT]**

- Renderer consumes an immutable `PositionView` snapshot (double-buffered), never
  the live `Position`. No engine mutation from render code; no GPU waits on the
  engine thread.
- Test: a snapshot taken, then 1000 engine moves applied, then the snapshot read
  — the snapshot is unchanged (asserts genuine isolation, including field
  columns).
- TSan gate enters the picture here.

## M4.3 Instanced board rendering

- One instance per cell and per piece; instance buffer is a flat upload derived
  from the flat cell array — the engine's memory layout is already the GPU's
  preferred layout, which is why L3 is a flat array.
- Draw-call budget: O(piece types + cell state classes), independent of board
  size. Bench with 1e6 cells.
- Frustum/visibility culling on the projected layout, not on N-D cells.

## M4.4 N-D projection (the interesting part)

A declarative projection config, so new view styles are data:

```toml
[view]
screen_axes = ["x", "y", "z"]     # 2 or 3 axes rendered spatially
grid_axes   = ["w", "t", "l"]     # remaining axes laid out as a grid of boards
grid_spacing = [2.5, 2.5, 4.0]
```

- Axes not mapped to screen space become a grid of sub-boards (the 5D-chess
  presentation), recursively for more axes.
- Interactive axis remapping, slice scrubbing, and fold/unfold animation between
  configurations.
- The projection math is shared with the M2 TUI viewer and is unit-tested there
  in text form — the renderer inherits tested layout logic and only adds pixels.
- **Tests:** layout golden tests (cell → screen-space position) for 2-D..6-D
  configurations; property test that the layout is injective (no two cells
  overlap).

## M4.5 Seam and wrap visualisation

- Seam descriptors from M3.5 drawn as tinted edges with their transform labelled.
- Hovering a piece shows ghost previews of its moves *through* seams, drawn at the
  wrapped destination, plus an optional "unfolded" overlay showing the continued
  ray in the covering space. Without this, non-orientable play is unreadable.
- **Tests:** ghost-preview destinations equal the engine's generated moves
  (the renderer must never invent a move). **[INVARIANT]**

## M4.6 Interaction

- Pick via instance-id readback (not CPU ray-casting against N-D geometry).
- Click-to-select, legal-destination highlighting straight from movegen, drag or
  click-click move entry, promotion chooser, undo, move list, variant picker.
- Input is recorded as an action log, so UI flows are replay-testable headlessly.
- **Tests:** scripted action logs drive the whole app in a headless harness and
  assert the resulting game state — real UI tests, no screenshots needed.

## M4.7 Scope boundary for M4

Explicitly *not* in M4: themes/skins, sound, PBR materials, shadows, animation
polish, accessibility pass, settings UI beyond what is needed to play. These are a
later polish milestone so that M4 cannot expand without an ADR.

## Generalization test

A new view style is a `[view]` block. A new piece's visual is an asset row, not
renderer code.

## Acceptance facts

1. Standard chess, Raumschach, a 4-D variant and a Klein variant are all playable
   with mouse input.
2. ≥ 60 fps at 1e6 rendered cells on the reference GPU; recorded in bench.
3. Zero validation-layer errors/warnings in a full play session.
4. Snapshot isolation test passes; TSan clean.
5. Layout golden tests pass for 2-D..6-D; layout injectivity property holds.
6. Move ghosts equal engine-generated moves for every shipped topology.
7. Headless action-log tests cover select/move/promote/undo/variant-switch.

## Status: complete for its stated scope, with three deviations

Recorded 2026-09-28.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| M4.1 foundation | Done: Vulkan 1.3, dynamic rendering, synchronization2, validation-as-errors |
| M4.2 engine/renderer boundary | Done: `view::PositionView` snapshots, isolation asserted by test |
| M4.3 instanced rendering | Done: one draw call for the whole board, cells and pieces as instances |
| M4.4 N-D projection | Done in `view::layout`, shared with the ASCII board, golden-tested to 6 axes |
| M4.5 seam visualisation | **Not done** - see below |
| M4.6 interaction | Done: `app::Session`, scripted action logs, pixel→cell picking |
| M4.7 scope boundary | Held: one material, no shadows, no post-processing, no meshes |

### Deviation 1: no VMA

ADR-0006 named the Vulkan Memory Allocator. The renderer makes about five allocations -
two images, three buffers - so a sub-allocator would be a dependency carrying no weight.
Allocation goes through one helper and `VulkanContext::findMemoryType`, so introducing
VMA later is a change in one place. Revisit when assets arrive (M9) and the allocation
count stops being a handful.

### Deviation 2: CPU picking rather than instance-id readback

Recorded in ADR-0011. The short version: cells are axis-aligned boxes at known
positions, so a ray-box test is exact, needs no GPU, and makes the whole click path
testable headlessly - which an id-buffer readback would not be.

### Deviation 3: the camera lives in `view`, not `render`

It is presentation maths with no Vulkan in it. Putting it below the renderer means
framing and picking are testable, and a front end can use them, with no graphics device.

### The gap: seam visualisation

M4.5 asked for seams to be drawn and for wrap previews. Not implemented. Glued boards
render correctly and their legal moves highlight correctly - including moves that wrap,
because highlights come from the engine rather than from the renderer's own idea of
geometry, which `tests/unit/app` asserts. What is missing is the *explanation*: nothing
on screen says that the a-file and the h-file are the same edge. `Geometry::faceTransform`
already exposes the seam descriptors, so this is renderer work, not engine work.

Playing a Klein bottle without it is genuinely hard, so this should land before anyone is
asked to play one seriously.

### Also delivered here, because M4 needed it

`src/game` (L80) - history, undo, repetition, and result adjudication with the
stalemate policy the variant declares. It was in the M1 plan and was skipped; the CLI
had been keeping its own history instead. `app::Session` needed a real one.

### Acceptance facts

1. Standard chess, Raumschach-style `cube5`, 4-D `hyper4` and Klein-bottle boards all
   render and are playable through the session layer. **Holds** - though "playable" here
   means the interaction layer, which the windowed front end drives; only the window
   itself is untested, by necessity.
2. 60 fps at 1e6 cells. **Not measured.** No benchmark for the renderer exists yet;
   the draw-call count is O(1) in board size by construction, but that is an argument,
   not a measurement.
3. Zero validation errors in a full session. **Holds** for every shipped variant, as a test.
4. Snapshot isolation. **Holds.** TSan is still not meaningful - nothing is threaded yet.
5. Layout goldens for 2-D..6-D and injectivity. **Holds.**
6. Move ghosts equal engine moves. **Holds structurally**: highlights come from
   `Game::legalMoves`, and the renderer has no move logic to disagree with.
7. Headless action-log tests for select/move/promote/undo/variant-switch. **Holds.**

## M4.5: from tech demo to game

Recorded 2026-09-29, after the visual direction was agreed.

M4 produced a renderer that drew coloured boxes with a status line in the terminal.
That demonstrated the engine; it was not a game. This pass closed the gap.

**Visual direction.** One rule holds the look together: *warm is the game you know,
cold is the geometry you don't*. Amber is the candle - selection, headings, the primary
action - and cyan is spent **only** where the board stops being flat: seams, wrapped
moves, extra axes. A player learns in one game that cyan means "this edge is not where
it looks", and that only works because nothing else is allowed to use it. The palette is
`view::Theme`, a struct, so retheming - or letting a Workshop variant carry its own -
never means touching the renderer.

**Pieces are assembled, not loaded.** A variant may declare a piece nobody anticipated,
so models cannot be files. Seven archetypes are built at load from primitives, a variant
may name one (`shape = "horn"`) and set a height, and anything it leaves out is derived
from *how the piece moves*: oriented atoms give a pawn's dome, three-axis atoms give the
unicorn's horn, several sliding families give a crown. Height encodes value, so the
tallest piece in an unfamiliar army is the one that matters most. An unknown name falls
back to a tower - a variant is never unplayable for want of a model.

**The interface** is Dear ImGui restyled until it stops looking like Dear ImGui: square
panels, warm borders, chunky bevelled controls whose press lands on the accent, Cinzel
for anything naming a thing and JetBrains Mono for anything a machine produced. Left
rail: variant nameplate, board readout, library. Right rail: status, ledger, controls.
Promotion is a modal built from the variant's own `promotes_to` list, so a variant that
promotes to a unicorn offers a unicorn.

**Promotion now asks.** The session stops and reports a pending promotion rather than
picking a queen, because "queen" is a guess in a variant that might promote to anything.

**Two fixes worth recording**, both found by looking at a rendered frame:

- The camera framed the board against the whole window, so the rails covered a quarter
  of it. The board now has its own viewport - the gap the rails leave - and picking uses
  the same rectangle, or a click would select a different cell than the one under the
  cursor.
- Framing used the usual bounding-sphere approximation, which clipped the near rank: a
  board is a wide flat slab seen at a steep angle, and a sphere is a poor stand-in for
  what reaches the frustum edges. It now fits the actual corners exactly, in one pass,
  with a half-cell margin because the bounds describe cell *centres*.

**Seam visualisation**, the gap M4 recorded, is now half closed: a glued face draws a
cyan edge on the sides the geometry actually identified, so the two halves of a seam can
be paired by eye. Ghost continuations past a seam and the unfold animation are still to
come.

### How the interface is verified

`chessbox_gui --shot FILE` renders one frame - board, rails, ledger, promotion state -
into an image with **no display present**, using SDL's dummy video driver for the window
the interface needs and the same offscreen target the headless tests use. It exits
nonzero if the validation layers said anything, and `ctest -R gui-frame` runs it. That
makes the whole screen reviewable, and regressions in it catchable, on a machine with no
compositor.

## M4.8 - Frame pacing and renderer performance (follow-up to M4.1)

Recorded 2026-09-30, after the library overtures made the per-frame cost visible. **M4.1
promised "Frames-in-flight = 2, per-frame descriptor and staging arenas, timeline
semaphores"; what shipped is one frame in flight, fully serialised.** The GPU is
otherwise idle - the board is a handful of instanced draws and there is no compute work
anywhere - so the wins are pacing, the composite, and the menu geometry, not more GPU
work.

- **Pipeline the frame.** `VulkanContext::submitAndWait` waits on a fence after every
  render (`src/render/vulkan_context.cpp:323`) and `Window::present` then calls
  `vkQueueWaitIdle` on top of it (`src/render/window.cpp:251`), so the CPU records and
  the GPU draws strictly in turn and never overlap. Two frames in flight with per-frame
  fences and acquire/render/present semaphores, and no `vkQueueWaitIdle` that a
  semaphore can express, removes a stall per frame and the input-to-photon latency it
  costs. Under FIFO vsync it does not raise the frame rate. **[INVARIANT: no redundant
  full-queue wait]**
- **Render straight into the swapchain image** on the interactive path. Every frame is
  drawn into the offscreen target and then blitted to the swapchain with a full-screen
  linear filter (`src/render/window.cpp:157`) - a wasted full-frame copy now that the
  window and the target are the same size. Keep the offscreen target for `--shot` and
  `readPixels`; dynamic-render the interactive frame into the acquired image. The
  `boardRect`/overlay seam (`src/render/board_renderer.hpp:122`) is unchanged.
- **MSAA.** Everything is `VK_SAMPLE_COUNT_1_BIT` (`src/render/offscreen_target.cpp:18`,
  `src/render/board_renderer.cpp:168,326,440`). The GPU has the headroom, so 4x MSAA
  with a resolve attachment in the dynamic-rendering path is close to free and visibly
  better on the board's edges and seams.
- **A frame-time benchmark, and the missing 1e6-cell one.** Acceptance fact 2 ("60 fps
  at 1e6 cells") was recorded as *not measured*. Add a `bench/` entry (or
  `--bench-frame`) that reports per-frame CPU and GPU time, so a regression is a number
  rather than an opinion.
- **A frame cap / "freeze decorations" setting.** The depth field and every overture
  animate forever, so the loop never idles on a screen that is otherwise static. A
  setting beside `app::Settings::vsync` to cap or freeze it is cheap and saves power.
- **The library screen is CPU geometry, not GPU work.** `overtureScene` is rebuilt every
  frame and `drawOverture` projects it into an `ImDrawList` (`src/render/ui.cpp:403`,
  `src/render/overture_scene.cpp`); `deco.cpp` is the same. The GPU rasterises it, but
  the vertices come from the CPU, which is where the animation cost lives - see M4.9.

### M4.8 as built (2026-09-30)

- **MSAA, 4x.** The offscreen target grew a 4-sample colour attachment and a 4-sample
  depth; the board and backdrop pipelines render into it and the pass resolves into the
  one-sample image the blur and `readPixels` use. The interface keeps rendering
  single-sample into the resolved image. Validation-clean across every `gui-*` capture.
- **A frame-time benchmark.** `chessbox_gui --bench-frame N` times N headless frames of the
  chosen screen and prints ms/frame and fps - a number rather than an opinion.
- **A frame cap.** `Settings::frameCap` (0 = uncapped) sleeps out the target period when
  vsync is off, so the ever-animating menus do not spin a core.
- **No redundant full-queue wait.** `Window::present` waits a fence for its own submission
  instead of `vkQueueWaitIdle`; the present semaphore already orders acquire and present.

**Deferred: two frames in flight, and rendering straight into the swapchain image.**
Both are one change: the interactive path deliberately renders into an offscreen target and
blits to the swapchain, which is ADR-0011 ("Headless-first renderer; the window is a blit"),
so removing the blit supersedes an accepted ADR and needs its own. The gain is
input-to-photon latency only - under the default FIFO vsync it does not raise the frame
rate (the plan says so) - while the interactive `present` path has **no headless test**:
`--shot` and every `gui-*` test exercise the offscreen render, not the swapchain present,
so a regression there is caught only by a human opening the game. Doing it blind is the
risk the rest of M4 exists to avoid. It is the one Wave-1 item left, and it wants an ADR
and a run on a real display.

### M4.8 remainder as built (2026-09-30)

Built, with **ADR-0018** superseding ADR-0011's blit. The interactive path now renders
straight into the acquired swapchain image - each image gets a render target that wraps it
and owns its own MSAA, depth and scratch - and `Window` carries a two-slot frame ring
(command buffer, fence and acquire semaphore per slot), with the renderer recording into
the caller's buffer instead of submitting. The per-frame instance buffer and blur
descriptors moved to per-slot storage, and no full-queue wait remains. The colour format
became a runtime property, since a multisample resolve and a dynamic-rendering pipeline
both require the attachment format to match the surface.

**Still needs a display.** The offscreen path is unchanged and all `render`/`gui-*` tests
pass, and a new headless test drives the exact interactive recording path into an image
with the swapchain's usages (both frame slots, validation-clean). But
`vkAcquireNextImageKHR`/`vkQueuePresentKHR` need a surface, so the acquire/present sequence
is verified only by running the game on a real compositor. Run
`./build/dev/src/gui/chessbox_gui standard` and confirm: the board draws, the interface
lays out, no validation messages, resizing works, and pause (which exercises the defocus
pass into the swapchain image) looks right.

## M4.9 - The animation budget (follow-up to M4.5)

The hand-authored overtures are the heaviest CPU work in the frame. The worst case is
`t6`: 25 patches x 16 cells x 4 sub-quads = 1600 quads, plus 68 wire boxes and 60 pips,
all rebuilt and re-emitted every frame. Cheapest wins first:

- **Memoise the quintic.** `src/render/quintic.hpp` is called per grid corner and does
  two `pow` and two `atan2`; the design prototype memoised it on the fixed `(k1, k2, u, v)`
  lattice and the C++ does not. A per-patch sample table (or a quantised cache) makes the
  gather and the knight fan's 60 addresses cheap.
- **Make `Pos` concrete.** It is a `std::function<OvVec3(float, float)>`
  (`src/render/overture_scene.cpp:86`), so every corner of every sub-quad is an indirect
  call, and `blendPos` wraps two of them. A small variant or template that `addGrid` can
  inline removes the indirection from the hottest loop.
- **Adaptive subdivision.** `sub` is a constant per scene; use the high value only while
  a surface is actually bending, and 1 when it is flat or fully formed.
- **Cache the scene for an unchanged `t`.** A scene is a pure function of `t`, so the
  700 ms formed-shape dwell (and a pinned `--shot`) can reuse one build.
- **The long-term fix: the same instanced path the board uses.** `board.vert` already
  does a per-instance transform, and M4.3's draw-call count is independent of board size.
  An overture is one more instance set, uploaded once per frame with the surface in the
  shader: per-pixel depth removes the painter's-sort artefacts the translucent glued
  surfaces show today, and MSAA applies to it. This is the shape M13's generic overtures
  should be built on, rather than a larger `ImDrawList`.

### M4.9 remainder: measured, and deferred (2026-09-30)

**Make `Pos` concrete - deferred.** Measured with `--bench-frame` and a `--clip` that
forces the scene to rebuild every frame (a pinned `t` does not, because the built-scene
cache holds). The worst case, `t6` with all 1600 quads rebuilding, costs about **5 ms/frame
more than a variant with no overture** - and that is Debug `-O0`, including PPM IO. With
the quintic memo and the scene cache in, `Pos` is off the steady-state path entirely; the
indirection only matters on the frames where `t` is actually changing, and even then it is
a fraction of a frame.

A concrete `Pos` means templating `addGrid` and every builder or writing a type-erased
`Pos` of our own - both touch essentially every function in a 3100-line file - to recover
under a millisecond at `-O2`. Not worth the churn. The long-term fix (the instanced path
above) is the one that should replace this code, not a micro-optimisation of a path about
to be rewritten.

Adaptive subdivision and the scene cache are already in (M4.8/M4.9 as built).
