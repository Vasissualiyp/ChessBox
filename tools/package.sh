# Build a self-contained package and smoke-test it from its own root (M16.2).
#
# `cmake --install` lays a prefix out the way the game already searches: the binaries in
# bin/, the variants and fonts in share/chessbox/. The binary resolves those relative to
# its working directory, so the package runs with no repository around it. The smoke test
# launches the packaged game headlessly (`--shot` needs no display) from the package root,
# which is the CI-shaped version of "a downloaded build launches, loads a variant and
# renders a frame".
#
#   tools/package.sh [PREFIX]        # default dist/chessbox
#
# Run inside the gfx dev shell (the renderer needs SDL3 + Vulkan). Pass a build directory
# in `CB_BUILD_DIR` to reuse one; the default is a Release build.
