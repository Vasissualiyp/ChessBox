/// The game's palette, as data.

/// Two themes ship. `manifold()` is the game's own look and the default: a bright, cool
/// instrument with the board several steps darker than the page, because the board is
/// what you came to look at and nothing else on screen may compete with it. `console()`
/// is the older candlelit one, kept because it is a second palette and a struct that
/// only ever holds one value is not really data.
///
/// The rule that survives both: **one accent, and geometry gets its own colours.**
/// `ember` is the accent - selection, headings, the primary action - and the seam ramp
/// is spent *only* where the board stops being flat. A player learns in one game that
/// those hues mean "this edge is not where it looks", and that only works if nothing
/// else ever uses them.
///
/// Being a struct rather than constants means a variant, or eventually a Workshop
/// package, can carry its own without anyone touching the renderer.
